This is a Makefile to download and install Ruby and Rails on a Mac using the RVM. RVM 
will install a version of Ruby and Rails in a directory called .rvm in your home directory.

This will prevent you breaking the default Ruby install and will also allow you to install
different Ruby/Rails versions for different users.

This code is tested on my 64-bit Macbook Pro with a OSX Lion install. YMMV.

Typical usage
=============

Put the Makefile on your Desktop, open a Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal) then type
the following:

 cd Desktop
 make clean install-rails

The Makefile will download and install RVM into ~/.rvm. It will then download and install
the latest release of Ruby v. 1.9.3 (including related libraries) and finally it will install
gem and Rails.

If the 'make' command runs with error, you will then need to log out and log back in again.

When you log back in, check that something like this has appeared in your ~/.bash_profile:

 [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

This code will setup your environment to use RVM's version of Ruby and Rails.
