This is a Makefile to download and install Ruby and Rails on a Mac using the RVM. RVM 
will install a version of Ruby and Rails in a directory called .rvm in your home directory.
This will prevent you breaking the default Ruby install and will also allow you to install
different Ruby/Rails versions for different users.

This code is tested on my 64-bit Macbook Pro with a OSX Lion install. YMMV.

Typical usage
=============

Put the Makefile on your Desktop, open a Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal) then type
the following:

 cd Desktop
 make clean install-rails

The Makefile will download and install RVM into ~/.rvm. It will then download and install
the latest release of Ruby v. 1.9.3 (including related libraries) and finally it will install
gem and Rails.
